make&play
This project is based on the idea of visual coding. The first contributers of this project @Hadi374 & Habib-Rezaie both started their first codings on Scratch. That impression pulled them toward making something like Scartch but a little bit different and expanded. Also, Scartch was not totally available to all, in different platforms, and if it was in some, it was not as good as it was on web. Therefore, the main goal of this project is to go beyond those limits of Scratch and make visual conding accessible to every individual, more fun,and more powerful.
